    <p>Let our planner guide you to share your final thoughts and messages meaningful way with your loved ones</p>
    <h5>Dear Loved Ones,</h5>
    <p>As I reflect on my life, I am grateful for the love and support you have given me. As much as I would like to stay with you forever, I know that my time here is limited. That's why I am writing these final wishes, to ease the burden on you and ensure
        that my farewell meets my wishes.</p>
    <p>My hope is that this planner will help guide you through these difficult times and make it easiest for you to celebrate my life in the unique way that I envision. Thank you for being a significant part of the story of my life.</p>
    <h5>With love,</h5>
